# HotelManagement-

##About the program
I created a c++ project to get familiar with the language and object orientaited concepts like,
File Handling for storing data(in my case personal record of the customer).

##General idea 
The customer can navigate around some options.
Customer can create a profile  which will be recorded as a file with .dat.
Customer can delete the file or refill the file.
Customer can book a room in the hotel ,it is possible to check customers details and edit details.
It is possible to display all the issued rooms in the hotel
